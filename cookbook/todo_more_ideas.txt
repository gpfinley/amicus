COOKBOOK IDEAS

Ideas organized by capabilities used.

TRANSLATING

...idea: transform concepts into DkPro format for use by coref annotator or something similar (never mind that coref in dkpro is broken)

TRANSLATING: FILTERING


TRANSLATING: MAPPING

mapping CUIs to UMLS preferred strings (easy)
...what else? something more complex/customizable?

MERGING

named entity voting from multiple systems?
partial acronym experiment: just combine


COLLECTING/EXPORTING

summarize all concepts by multiple systems
get unigram frequencies, both by doc and across systems
can summarize concepts as encountered in different parts of the doc (again, use CLAMP sections)


IDIOMS

Filtering on a different annotation (MERGER)

filter annotations based on negation from other system
...something with number or range annotations in ctakes?
...something with parsing? filter based on dependency parsing??
crazy medications idea: use CLAMP section IDs and cTAKES med mentions to find differences between PMH/HPI and A/P

Filtering on a different field of the same annotation (TRANSLATOR + MERGER)

get only positive annotations (acrabbrevexpansion, e.g.)

Enforcing minimum vote (MERGER<CountingDistiller> + TRANSLATOR<Filter> + MERGER)

...

Evaluating (MERGER + COLLECTOR)

...
named entity evaluation: single system (show the basic merger + collector idiom)
named entity evaluation: multiple systems
named entity evaluation: merged systems and multiple hypotheses (different voting schemes, etc.)
mapping and evaluation (equivalent answer mapper)


GRAND COMBINATION: TRANSLATING, MERGING, EVALUATING

full acronym experiment: draw from three systems, combine, evaluate, export
