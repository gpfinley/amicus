This folder contains recipes and the mapper configuration used for the experiments in the Finley et al. 2017 CRI Summit presentation entitled "Using ensembles of NLP engines without a common type system to improve abbreviation disambiguation."

Also included is a single type system description (a union of the cTAKES, CLAMP, and BioMedICUS 1.5 and 1.6 type systems) that can be used to build AMICUS to include the proper types.

Unfortunately, these recipes cannot be run as they are because they rely on test data that contains identifying information and cannot be publicly shared. Our hope is that you can use them for ideas or adapt them for your own data.
